# tern_for_gedit

This is a simple gedit plugin that provides code completion results
based on [tern](https://github.com/marijnh/tern).

## installation

Copy `tern.plugin` and `tern/` to `~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/`.

This plugin expects `tern` to be installed globally.
So if you havenâ€™t already:

    $ sudo npm install --global tern

## TODO

* maybe a function definition popunder to show the expected parameters, like in
  the tern web demo
